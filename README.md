### Hi! I'm Adin üë®‚Äçüíª

Right now, I am:
- Graduated from [Business and Computer Science (BUCS)](https://mybcom.sauder.ubc.ca/bucs) at UBC.
- Playing [Valorant](https://tracker.gg/valorant/profile/riot/Bonny%20B%23BEANS/overview) with the occasional [Teamfight Tactics](https://lolchess.gg/profile/na/bonnyb) sesh on iPad.
- Making music and rapping as my alter ego, [Bonny B](https://open.spotify.com/artist/5STtNYOyTyEuAVm0ceLiEQ?si=_tApMniFTh-Bpa9GSnHMCg).
- Enjoying the graduated life until I return to Meta in Summer 2022.
